An interactive theme editor for the WordPress Admin.

== Description ==

Elastic is an interactive theme editor for the WordPress Admin. Elastic breaks themes down into modules, which you can arrange in any configuration via drag-and-drop. Users can customize a theme's fonts and styles, or just rearrange its structure. Themes created with Elastic can be edited at any timeâ€”users can save their progress, or distribute their theme. Elastic builds themes with the Elastic theme framework, which allows theme developers to use the editor as a starting point for incredibly customized themes.
