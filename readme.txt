Elastic is an interactive theme editor for the WordPress Admin. Elastic breaks themes down into modules, which you can arrange in any configuration via drag-and-drop. Users can customize a theme's fonts and styles, or just rearrange its structure. Themes created with Elastic can be edited at any timeâ€”users can save their progress, or distribute their theme.
